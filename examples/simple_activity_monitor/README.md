# simple activity monitor

This example is based on the utility client example from websocketpp. It runs a listener
service for messages generated by the Harmony Hub and logs a description of their content
to screen.

## Usage

Run the executable `harmony_monitor`

Command List:
    connect <IP address>
    close [<close code:default=1000>] [<close reason>]
    help: Display this help text
    quit: Exit the program

Optionally you may pass the Hub's IP address directly on the command line for instant connect.
